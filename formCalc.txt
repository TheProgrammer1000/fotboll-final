  Form Calculation Basics

    3 points for a win

    1 point for a draw

    0 points for a loss

    Average points per match over last 5 matches

Your Specific Values

    formHome: 1

        Average points from last 5 home matches = 1.0

        Total points = 1.0 * 5 = 5 points

        Possible scenarios:

            1 win (3) + 2 draws (1+1) + 2 losses = 5 points

            5 draws (1×5) = 5 points

        Indicates: Struggling home form

    formAway: 2.6

        Average points from last 5 away matches = 2.6

        Total points = 2.6 * 5 = 13 points

        Possible scenarios:

            4 wins (3×4=12) + 1 draw (1) = 13 points

            3 wins (9) + 4 draws (4) [but only 5 matches total]

        Indicates: Excellent away form

Why This Matters for Predictions

    Maximum possible = 3.0 (5 wins)

    Good form threshold ≈ 2.0+

    Poor form threshold ≈ 1.0-

Interpretation Guide
Form Value	Rating	Typical Performance
2.5-3.0	Exceptional	Consistent wins
2.0-2.4	Strong	Regular wins with few draws
1.5-1.9	Average	Mix of wins/draws/losses
1.0-1.4	Below Average	More losses than wins
0.0-0.9	Poor	Frequent losses
